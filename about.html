<hr>

<p class = 'blocktext'>Sergey Brin is perhaps best known as a co-founder of Google alongside his colleague Larry Page. Born in Moscow, Russia in 1973 Brin moved to the United States at the age of 6, going on to study mathematics and computer science at the University of Maryland and then aquiring a PhD in computer science at Stanford.</p>
<p class = 'blocktext'> Brin and Page became friends whilst studying at Stanford, developing an algorithm together to measure the importance of web pages, they realised this algorithm could be used to build a search engine much more powerful than anything currently in existence.[1] In 1998 Brin and Page co-founded Google. Dr. Brin served as its president of technology for 10 years and has been the president of Google's parent company, Alphabet inc, since October 2015.[2] </p>
