<h2>IMPACT</h2>

<hr>

<p class = 'blocktext'>The technological advancement that Sergey Brin and Larry Page made when they created the search engine Google would revolutionise the way we consume content on the internet for years to come. Google made pages on the internet accessible to the layman, it "indexed the internet extraordinarily well... and in such a way that the user did not have to know how to use the index or Boolean search methods"[1]. </p>

<p class = 'blocktext'>From this base Google, with Brin spearheading many projects, went on to make many significant advancements in the field of data and computing - contuining to make information on the internet more and more accessible to the everyday user.</p>
