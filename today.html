<h2>TODAY</h2>

<hr>

<p class = 'blocktext'>Millions of people use technology stemming from the accomplishments of Sergey Brin every single day. From using their Android smartphone to looking up the name of an actor in the movie they're watching - Google and it's associated companies have a profound effect on the way everyday people live thier lives. Testament to the remarkable accomplishment's of Brin's search engine is it's infiltration of the English language, the term 'Google it' - used to mean looking something up on the internet - has made its way into many people's everyday vocabulary, highlighting our reliance on the technologly that Brin pioneered.</p>

<p class = 'blocktext'>The algorithm Brin created to rank web pages by importance laid the foundation for all modern day search engines, and although it has been built upon, the core idea of finding the most relevant information for the user is still central to how all search engines operate. It could be argued that at some point someone else would have come up with the idea if Brin and Page hadn't done it themselves, but Brin's ideas about finding and organising information have undoubtedly helped to mould the internet into what it is today.</p> 

<p class = 'blocktext'> Looking forwards it is hard to imagine Google, or Brin himself, going away anytime soon. The projects such as <a class = 'inline' href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass>Google Glass</a>, Google's wind farms off the east coast of the US, and their technology pioneering self-driving vehichles all promise to further strech the boundaries of what is possible with modern technology. There is little doubt that Brin will continue to innovate and revoloutionise the tech industry. </p>
